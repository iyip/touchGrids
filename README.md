Touch Grids
==================================================

Touch Grids is a mobile html5 web appliation showcasing of various touch gestures, built on top of [zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) javascript framework.
It displays a 3 by 3 grid with a short quote in each grid. It shows usages of mobile touch gestures such as tap, swipe left, swipe right, swipe up,
swipe down and pinch in. It also includes usages of zepto data api, zepto ajax api, as well as browser history support for back and forward buttons
with [history.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js). It works well on both iOS and Android.


How to use:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the overview page showing the 3 by 3 grid, tap into one grid to see the detail of the block.
* On the detail page, swipe left, right, up and down to see the adjacent block.
* If you have gone beyond the original 3 by 3 grid, then new quote will be retrieved via ajax call.
* Pinch in (in iOS) on the detail page will lead you back to overview page. On android, use the back button.
* You can also use browser's back and forward buttons to switch between overview and detail pages.
